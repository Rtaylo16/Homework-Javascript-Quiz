***Javascript Quiz***

I have created a javascript designed to test your JAVASCRIPT knowledge.
I have designed the quiz through various methods
*DOM elements
*Event listeners
*Functions
*SetInterval
*Local Storage



When the start button is clicked the quiz starts
Upon starting the timer counts down from 60 seconds
You are presented there your first question.
If you answer correctly your score increases 
But if you answer incorrectly 20 seconds is taken off the clock.
When the first question is answered you go on to the next question.
When the second question is answered the quiz completes
Upon finishing your quiz you are presented with your score
Then you can enter in your Initials and Score into local storage
